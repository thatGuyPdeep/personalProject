Build 1:
Environment(Ground and Obstacles)
Camera
Player Camera
Player, Player Model
Gun, Gun Model
Materials for all models

Scripts:
PlayerMotor - for movement
PlayerController - for controlling the player

Camera Rotation - 
Along x-axis:
	rotate the player
Along y-axis:
	only rotate the camerea not the player

(don't wanna mess with y-axis because it will mess with the movement of the player(because player will rotate with the camera in y-axis)).
